  <p class="">
    Zambia Open Community Schools (ZOCS) is a vibrant and flagship organisation for Community Schools in Zambia since 1992 that empowers communities to provide quality basic education to OVC, especially girls and children with disabilities. Premised on the principle that every child has a
    “right to education”, ZOCS, through its three-pillar approach of Advocacy, Capacity Building and Service Delivery, has accomplished much for the children and people of Zambia, reaching out to 259,691 learners (132,459 Boys and 127,232 Girls) in 1,385 demonstration Community Schools across 97 Districts in all the 10 provinces of Zambia.
